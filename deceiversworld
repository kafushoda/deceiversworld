        <span class="chartext"><p>An esteemed captain of space and the leader of his own team...who wouldn't follow such a charistmatic leader into this treacherous game?
            Steering the game like one of his own spaceships, Fox grips the wheel expectedly well, confidently with the fervor to win.
            He's clever, always ready to flash a grin...but
            also cares very deeply about the other players as a team. 
            Fox joins with a motivated attitude, even inspiring feelings of unity and teamwork 
            among everyone within just the first five minutes of the game. Such a leader indeed...but could he possibly be the Mole?

        <span class="chartext"><p>The most loyal and dainty of all...the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom joins the game with a carefree demeanor and
            questionable
            motives. She is sweet, kind, and ultimately the fairest of them all. As a natural overseer and ruler of her kingdom,
            she finds exerting copious amounts of stress in the game of 'The Mole' as unnecessary, preferring much more to sit back and hope
            the rest of the game goes smoothly. She also seems to understand the game very well and uses it to her advantage.
             But where does she get her knowledge from? Could it be that Peach may be the all-knowing saboteur?

        <span class="chartext"><p>He's the first member of the DK crew...and also the first, well, <i>only</i> player to introduce himself into the game via loud YELL.
            You actually see him vigorously hollering for more than half of the time he's in the game, either passionately with a smile or angrily with palpable fury.
            DK jumps right into this game, ready to play. But this boisterous guy actually doesn't care how the game goes: all this energetic ape 
            really wants
        is to have a good time. But does that mean he'll do it by covertly sabotaging the game as the chosen agent?

        <span class="chartext jokerp"><p>
           How stylish, intelligent, and sneaky do you want your Mole player to be? Joker brings all to the table, seemingly perfect for the game's premise, albeit slightly show-off-y in his ways. Even with a mask on, Joker
            excels both mentally and physically 
            in nearly every mission. He always seems propelled to win.
            Yet, he has many tricks up his sleeve, and maybe the moments he <i>does</i> add money
            are just instances when others are looking at him. He doesn't want to cause havoc...does he? 
            Are his subtle smiles friendly...or ones of deception as the selected deceiver?

        <span class="chartext jokerp"><p>Wii Fit is one of the strongest both physically... and tauntingly. She is sassy in her sentiments, as pompous as she is pretentious,
             and doesn't see the game as anything less than a compeition.
            She boasts a very active body, and unfortunately for some others, an active mind in complement that's not afraid to speak 
            what she's thinking. Much to her own chuckles, she knows that can sometimes appear rather condescending and brash
            to others. But when she does see strength and value in someone...she 
            tends to treat them nicely. Hmm...what an interesting choice she would be as the Mole...if this trainer 
            were indeed the treasonous traitor.
